# Home Automation with Arduino

## Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive Home Automation system using Arduino, Node.js, and HTML. The system allows users to control various home devices such as lights, fans, and appliances via a web interface or voice commands. Additionally, the system can automate tasks based on environmental conditions like day/night.

## Features

- **User Interface**: Control home devices through an intuitive web interface.
- **Server-Side Logic**: Handle HTTP requests and communicate with Arduino microcontrollers using Node.js.
- **Arduino Integration**: Interface with sensors and actuators using the Arduino IDE.
- **Speech Recognition**: Enable voice commands for device control.
- **Environmental Automation**: Automate tasks based on weather conditions, such as adjusting lighting for day/night.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For client-side scripting and speech recognition.
- **Node.js**: For server-side logic and communication with Arduino.
- **Arduino IDE**: For programming Arduino microcontrollers.
- **Weather API**: For automating tasks based on environmental conditions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/home-automation-arduino.git
   cd home-automation-arduino
   ```

2. **Install Node.js Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Upload Arduino Sketch**
   - Open the `arduino` folder in Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

4. **Run the Server**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Access the User Interface**
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Web Interface**
   - Control various home devices by clicking buttons on the web interface.

2. **Voice Commands**
   - Use the speech recognition feature to control devices with voice commands.

3. **Environmental Automation**
   - The system automatically adjusts settings based on day/night conditions.
